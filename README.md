# 🔋 Synthetic Power System Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project creates synthetic datasets simulating electric load, solar, and wind power generation patterns over time. It demonstrates basic data exploration and visualization techniques using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- To understand power system load and renewable energy variability.
- To practice data manipulation and visualization skills.
- To build a foundational project relevant for AI research roles in power systems.

---

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Install them via: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

---

## ▶️ How to Run
- Clone the repo or download the notebook.
- Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
- Run each cell to generate and visualize synthetic energy data.

---

## 📈 Output Example
You’ll visualize:

- Hourly electric load variation
- Solar generation curve
- Wind power randomness

---

## 📊 Sample Output
- Load vs. Solar/Wind Generation (Line Chart + Area Chart)
- Net Load Profile (Load minus Renewable Generation)

## 💡 Insights
- Solar generation peaks midday, while wind power is more variable and random throughout the day.
- Net load shows a typical evening peak after solar generation declines, a common pattern in power grids.

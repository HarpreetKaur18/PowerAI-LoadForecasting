# PowerAI-LoadForecasting
## Overview
This project creates synthetic datasets simulating electric load, solar, and wind power generation patterns over time. It demonstrates basic data exploration and visualization techniques using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Purpose
- To understand power system load and renewable energy variability.
- To practice data manipulation and visualization skills.
- To build a foundational project relevant for AI research roles in power systems (e.g., OATI).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Install required packages (if not already installed):
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
